Traditionally, types seen as a checking mechanism. TyDD uses them as a design/construction tool instead.

> We put the type first, treating it as a plan for a program, and use the compiler and type checker as our assistant, guiding us to a complete and working program that satisfies the type

Types as models

> When you write a program, you’ll often have a conceptual model in your head (or, if you’re disciplined, even on paper) of how it’s supposed to work, how the components interact, and how the data is organized. This model is likely to be quite vague at first and will become more precise as the program evolves and your understanding of the concept develops.

> Types allow you to make these models explicit in code and ensure that your implementation of a program matches the model in your head. Idris has an expressive type system that allows you to describe a model as precisely as you need, and to refine the model at the same time as developing the implementation.

This book is adding greatly to my type evangelism vocabulary.
