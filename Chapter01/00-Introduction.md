> Iâ€™ll also introduce the two most distinctive features of the Idris language: **holes**, which stand for parts of programs that are yet to be written, and the use of types as a **first-class** language construct.

I still do not have an intuition for how "types depending on terms" opens up doors to any level of precision (which is what I understand full spectrum dependent types bring to the table). I know of lambda cube, but do not understand different levels of expressivity associated with its vertices. Perhaps reading some material in the appendix will fix that.
