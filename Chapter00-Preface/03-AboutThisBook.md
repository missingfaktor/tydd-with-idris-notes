> "Types are often seen as a tool for checking for errors, with the programmer writing a complete program first and using the type checker to detect errors. In TyDD, you use types as a tool for constructing programs, and the type checker as your assistant to guide you to a complete and working program."

I [have been using](http://www.rahulsteapot.com/speaking/#tdd-is-dead-long-live-tydd) the same term – type-driven development – to describe how I use Scala (and other languages) for my work and hobby projects. There is a constant dialog between the programmer and the type system, and types help direct design of programs.

However, whatever little bit I have seen of Idris so far, the dialog feels much more constant, and much more fruitful. Already. This is exciting!

> This book is aimed at developers who want to learn about **the state of the art in using sophisticated type systems** to help develop **robust** software. It aims to provide an accessible introduction to dependent types, and to show **how modern type-based techniques can be applied to real-world problems**.

Sounds like I could benefit from this book! :wink:
