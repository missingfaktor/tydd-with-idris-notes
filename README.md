# "Type-Driven Development with Idris" Notes

These are my notes as I work through the book ["Type-Driven Development with Idris"](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris).

This is one of the best Computer Science and Software Engineering books that I have ever read. You should buy it!
