> "[...] by using dependent types, you describe precise properties of a program. The idea is that if you can express a program’s intention in its type, and the program successfully type-checks, then the program must behave as intended. An important (if ambitious and long-term) goal of Idris is to make the results of this research accessible to developers, and correspondingly reduce the possibility of critical software failures."

There is a notion in software development community that languages with powerful type systems are useful only for ensuring the sort of correctness requirements that you have in life-critical software. I could see them reading the above text as confirming their preconceived notions. This is empirically false to me, and I wonder why this narrative was picked by the author.

> "You’ll learn about the **fundamentals** of dependent types, how to use types to **define programs interactively**, and how to **refine programs and types** as your understanding of a problem evolves. You’ll also learn about some real-world applications of type-driven development, particularly in dealing with **state**, **protocols**, and **concurrency**."

State, protocols, and concurrency – I am loving the real world focus of this book!
