-- NEW TERMINOLOGY!
--
-- Type family:
-- "Dependent data types like Vehicle are therefore sometimes referred to as
-- families of types, because youâ€™re defining multiple related types at the
-- same time. The power source is an index of the Vehicle family. The index
-- tells you exactly which Vehicle type you mean."
--
-- Index: (Seems like a loose term)
-- "A parameter is unchanged across the entire structure. In this (Vect) case,
-- every element of the vector has the same type.
-- An index may change across a structure. In this case, every subvector has a
-- different length."
