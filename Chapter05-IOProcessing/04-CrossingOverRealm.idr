-- "Realistically, though, inputs to functions donâ€™t come from such a carefully
-- controlled environment where the Idris type checker is available. In
-- practice, when a complete program is compiled and executed, inputs to
-- functions will originate from some external source: perhaps a field on a
-- web page, or user input at the console."

-- Dependent pairs help us cross over from dynamic realm to static realm.
-- (My intuition suggests subtyping (OO style) and existentials allow us to do
-- the same.)
